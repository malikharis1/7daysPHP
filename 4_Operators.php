There are many useful operators in PHP, but here are some commonly used ones:

Assignment Operators: Used to assign values to variables. The basic assignment operator is "=".

Arithmetic Operators: Used to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The most common arithmetic operators are "+", "-", "*", "/", and "%".

Comparison Operators: Used to compare two values and return a boolean value of true or false. The most common comparison operators are "==", "===" (identical), ">", "<", ">=", and "<=".

Logical Operators: Used to combine two or more conditions and return a boolean value of true or false. The most common logical operators are "&&" (and), "||" (or), and "!" (not).

String Operators: Used to concatenate two or more strings together. The most common string operator is "." (dot).

Increment/Decrement Operators: Used to increment or decrement a variable by one. The most common increment and decrement operators are "++" and "--".

Ternary Operator: Used to assign a value to a variable based on a condition. It is a shorthand for an if-else statement. The syntax is: (condition) ? true-value : false-value.
